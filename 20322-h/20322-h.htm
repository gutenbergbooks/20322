<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>CORRECTIONS ADOPTED BY POPE FROM THE DUNCES.</h3>

  <p>In Pope's "Letter to the Honourable James Craggs," dated June 15,
  1711, after making some observations on Dennis's remarks on the <i>Essay
  on Criticism</i>, he says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Yet, to give this man his due, he has objected to one or two lines
  with reason; and I will alter them in case of another edition: I will
  make my enemy do me a kindness where he meant an injury, and so serve
  instead of a friend."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>An interesting paper might be drawn up from the instances, for they
  are rather numerous, in which Pope followed out this very sensible rule.
  I do not remember seeing the following one noted. One of the heroes of
  the <i>Dunciad</i>, Thomas Cooke, the translator of Hesiod, was the
  editor of a periodical published in monthly numbers, in 8vo., of which
  nine only appeared, under the title of <i>The Comedian, or Philosophical
  Inquirer</i>, the first number being for April, and the last for
  December, 1732. It contains some curious matter, and amongst other papers
  is, in No. 2., "A Letter in Prose to Mr. Alexander Pope, occasioned by
  his Epistle in Verse to the Earl of Burlington." It is very abusive, and
  was most probably written either by Cooke or Theobald. After quoting the
  following lines as they then stood:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"He buys for Topham drawings and designs,</p>
      <p>For Fountain statues, and for Curio coins,</p>
      <p>Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne alone,</p>
      <p>And books for Mead, and rarities for Sloane,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>the letter-writer thus unceremoniously addresses himself to the
  author:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Rarities! how could'st thou be so silly as not to be particular in
  the rarities of Sloane, as in those of the other five persons? What
  knowledge, what meaning is conveyed in the word <i>rarities</i>? Are not
  some drawings, some statues, some coins, all monkish manuscripts, and
  some books, <i>rarities</i>? Could'st thou not find a trisyllable to
  express some parts of nature for a collection of which that learned and
  worthy physician is eminent? Fy, fy! correct and write&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne alone,</p>
      <p>And books for Mead, and butterflies for Sloane.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 542 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page542"></a>{542}</span></p>

  <p>"Sir Hans Sloane is known to have the finest collection of butterflies
  in England, and perhaps in the world; and if rare monkish manuscripts are
  for Hearne only, how can rarities be for Sloane, unless thou specifyest
  what sort of rarities? O thou numskull!"&mdash;No. 2., pp.
  15&mdash;16.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The correction was evidently an improvement, and therefore Pope wisely
  accepted the benefit, and was the channel through which it was conveyed;
  and the passage accordingly now stands as altered by the
  letter-writer.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON SEVERAL MISUNDERSTOOD WORDS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>Continued from</i> p. 522.)</p>

  <p><i>Dare</i>, to lurk, or cause to lurk; used both transitively and
  intransitively. Apparently the root of <i>dark</i> and <i>dearn</i>.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Here, quod he, it ought ynough suffice,</p>
      <p>Five houres for to slepe upon a night:</p>
      <p>But it were for an olde appalled wight,</p>
      <p>As ben thise wedded men, that lie and <i>dare</i>,</p>
      <p>As in a fourme sitteth a wery hare."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Tyrwhitt's utterly unwarranted adoption of Speght's interpretation is
  "<i>Dare</i>, v. Sax. to stare." The reader should always be cautious how
  he takes upon trust a glossarist's sly fetch to win a cheap repute for
  learning, and over-ride inquiry by the mysterious letters Sax. or
  Ang.-Sax. tacked on to his exposition of an obscure word. There is no
  such Saxon vocable as <i>dare</i>, to stare. Again, what more frequent
  blunder than to confound a secondary and derivative sense of a word with
  its radical and primary&mdash;indeed, sometimes to allow the former to
  usurp the precedence, and at length altogether oust the latter: hence it
  comes to pass, that we find <i>dare</i> is one while said to imply
  peeping and prying, another while trembling or crouching; moods and
  actions merely consequent or attendant upon the elementary signification
  of the word:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I haue an hoby can make larkys to <i>dare</i>."</p>
      <p class="i1">Skelton's <i>Magnifycence</i>, vol. i. p.269. l. 1358., Dyce's edition;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>on which line that able, but therein mistaken editor's note is, "<i>to
  dare</i>, i.&nbsp;e. to be terrified, to tremble" (he however also adds, it
  means to lurk, to lie hid, and remits his reader to a note at p. 379.,
  where some most pertinent examples of its true and only sense are given),
  to which add these next:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ¬∑ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ¬∑&nbsp; &nbsp;let his grace go forward,</p>
      <p>And <i>dare</i> vs with his cap, like larkes."</p>

  <p><i>Die and live.</i>&mdash;This <i>hysteron proteron</i> is by no

  <p>All manner of whimsical and farfetched constructions have been put by
  the commentators upon this very homely sentence. As long as the question
  was, whether their wits should have licence to go a-woolgathering or no,
  one could feel no great concern to interfere: but it appears high time to
  come to Shakspeare's rescue, when <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span>
  "clever" old commentator, with some little variation in the letters, and
  not much less in the sense, reads "kills" for dies; but then, in the
  <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, Act II. Sc. 3., the same "clever"
  authority changes "cride-game (cride I ame), said I well?" into "curds
  and cream, said I well?"&mdash;an alteration certainly not at odds with
  the host's ensuing question, "said I well?" saving that that, to
  liquorish palate, might seem a rather superfluous inquiry.</p>

  <p>Except in Shakspeare's behalf, it would not have been worth while to

  <p><i>Kindly</i>, in accordance with kind, viz. nature. Thus, the love of
  a parent for a child, or the converse, is kindly: one without natural
  affection (<span title="astorgos" class="grk"

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Thence <i>kindly</i> expanded into its wider meaning of general
  benevolence. So under another phase of its primary sense we find the
  epithet used to express the excellence and characteristic qualities
  proper to the idea or standard of its subject, to wit, genuine, thrifty,
  well-liking, appropriate, not abortive, monstrous, prodigious,
  discordant. In the Litany, "the <i>kindly</i> fruits of the earth" is, in
  the Latin versions "genuinus," and by Mr. Boyer rightly translated "les
  fruits de la terre chaqu'un selon son esp√®ce;" for which Pegge takes him
  to task, and interprets <i>kindly</i> "fair and good," through mistake or
  preference adopting the acquired and popular, in lieu of the radical and
  elementary meaning of the word. (<i>Anonymiana</i>, pp. 380&mdash;1.
  Century <span class="sc">viii</span>. No. <span class="sc">lxxxi</span>.)
  The conjunction of this adjective with <i>gird</i> in a passage of
  <i>King Henry VI</i>. has sorely gravelled <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier</span>: twice over he essays, with equal success, to expound its
  purport. First, <i>loc. cit.</i>, he finds fault with <i>gird</i> as
  being employed in rather an unusual manner; or, if taken in its common
  meaning of taunt or reproof, then that <i>kindly</i> is said ironically;
  because there seems to be a contradiction in terms. (Monck Mason's rank
  distortion of the words, there cited, I will not pain the reader's sight
  with.) <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> note concludes with a
  supposition that <i>gird</i> may possibly be a misprint. This is the
  misery! Men will sooner suspect the text than their own understanding or
  researches. In Act I. Sc. 1. of <i>Coriolanus</i>, dissatisfied with his
  previous note, <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> tries again, and
  thinks a <i>kindly gird</i> may mean a gentle reproof. That the reader
  may be able to judge what it does mean, it will be necessary to quote the
  king's <i>gird</i>, who thus administers a kindly rebuke to the malicious
  preacher against the sin of malice, <i>i.e.</i> chastens him with his own
  rod:</p>

  <p><i>Kindly</i> is quite a pet word with Andrewes, as, besides the
  passages quoted, he employs it in nearly the same sense in vol. iii., at
  pp. 18. 34. 102. 161. 189. 262. 308. 372. 393. 397.; in vol. i., at pp.
  100. 125. 151. 194. 214.; in vol. ii. at pp. 53. 157. 307. 313. 338. The
  same immortal quibbler is also very fond of the word <i>item</i>, using
  it, as our cousins across the Atlantic and we in Herefordshire do at the
  present day, for "a hint."</p>

<h3>DEVONIANISMS.</h3>

  <p><i>Miserable.</i>&mdash;<i>Miserable</i> is very commonly used in
  Devonshire in the signification of <i>miserly</i>, with strange effect
  until one becomes used to it. Hooker the Judicious, a Devonshire man,
  uses the word in this sense in the <i>Eccl. Polity</i>, book v. ch. lxv.
  p. 21.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"By means whereof it cometh also to pass that the mean which is virtue
  seemeth in the eyes of each extreme an extremity; the liberal-hearted man
  is by the opinion of the prodigal <i>miserable</i>, and by the judgment
  of the <i>miserable</i> lavish."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Few.</i>&mdash;Speaking of broth, people in Devon say a <i>few
  broth</i> in place of a little, or some broth. I find a similar use of
  the word in a sermon preached in 1550, by Thomas Lever, Fellow of St.
  John's College, preserved by Strype (in his <i>Eccles. Mem.</i>, ii.
  422.). Speaking of the poor students of Cambridge, he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"At ten of the clock they go to dinner, whereas they be content with a
  penny piece of beef among four, having a <i>few pottage</i> made of the
  broth of the same beef, with salt and oatmeal, and nothing else."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Figs, Figgy.</i>&mdash;Most commonly <i>raisins</i> are called
  <i>figs</i>, and plum-pudding <i>figgy</i> pudding. So with plum-cake, as
  in the following rhymes:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Rain, rain, go to Spain,</p>
      <p>Never come again:</p>
      <p>When I brew and when I bake,</p>
      <p>I'll give you a <i>figgy</i> cake."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>Against</i> is used like the classical <i>advers√πm</i>, in the
  sense of <i>towards</i> or <i>meeting</i>. I have heard, both in
  Devonshire and in Ireland, the expression to send <i>against</i>, that
  is, to send <i>to meet</i>, a person, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The foregoing words and expressions are probably provincialisms rather
  than Devonianisms, good old English forms of expression; as are, indeed,
  many of the so-called Hibernicisms.</p>

  <p><i>Pilm, Farroll.</i>&mdash;What is the derivation of
  <i>pilm</i>=dust, so frequently heard in Devon, and its derivatives,
  <i>pilmy</i>, dusty: it <i>pilmeth</i>? The cover of a book is there
  called the <i>farroll</i>; what is the derivation of this word?</p>

<h3>THE POEMS OF ROWLEY.</h3>

  <p>The tests propounded by <span class="sc">Mr. Keightley</span> (Vol.
  vii. p. 160.) with reference to the authenticity of the poems of Rowley,
  namely the use of "its," and the absence of the feminine rhyme in
  <i>e</i>, furnish additional proof, if any were wanting, that Chatterton
  was the author of those extraordinary productions. Another test often
  insisted upon is the occurrence, in those poems, of borrowed
  thoughts&mdash;borrowed from poets of a date posterior to that of their
  pretended origin. Of this there is one instance which seems to have
  escaped the notice of Chatterton's numerous annotators. It occurs at the
  commencement of <i>The Tournament</i>, in the line,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The <i>worlde</i> bie <i>diffraunce</i> ys ynn <i>orderr</i> founde."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It will be seen that this line, a very remarkable one, has been
  cleverly condensed from the following passage in Pope's <i>Windsor
  Forest</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"But as the <i>world</i>, harmoniously confused,</p>
      <p>Where <i>order</i> in variety we see;</p>
      <p>And where, tho' all things <i>differ</i>, all agree."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This sentiment has been repeated by other modern writers. Pope himself
  has it in the <i>Essay on Man</i>, in this form,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The lights and shades, whose well-accorded strife</p>
      <p>Gives all the strength and colour of our life."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It occurs in one of Pascal's <i>Pens√©es</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"J'√©crirai ici mes pens√©es sans ordre, et non pas peut-√™tre dans une
  confusion sans dessein: C'est le v√©ritable ordre, et qui marquera
  toujours mon objet par le d√©sordre m√™me."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Butler has it in the line,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For discords make the sweetest airs."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Bernardin de St. Pierre, in his <i>Etudes de la Nature</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"C'est des contraires que r√©sulte l'harmonie du monde."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And Burke, in nearly the same words, in his <i>Reflections on the
  French Revolution</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"You had that action and counteraction, which, in the natural and in
  the political world, from the reciprocal struggle of discordant powers,
  draws out the harmony of the universe."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Nor does the sentiment belong exclusively to the moderns. I find it in
  Horace's twelfth Epistle:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Nil parvum sapias, et adhuc sublimia cures,</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ¬∑ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ¬∑ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ¬∑ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ¬∑ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ¬∑ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ¬∑</p>
      <p>Quid velit et possit rerum concordia discors."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 545 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page545"></a>{545}</span></p>

  <p>Lucan, I think, has the same expression in his <i>Pharsalia</i>; and
  it forms the basis of Longinus's remark on the eloquence of
  Demosthenes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

</blockquote>

  <p>It may be said that, as Pope adopted the thought from Horace or Lucan,
  so a poet of the fifteenth century (such as the supposed Rowley) might
  have taken it from the same sources. But a comparison of the line in
  <i>The Tournament</i> with those in <i>Windsor Forest</i> will show that
  the borrowing embraces not only the thought, but the very words in which
  it is expressed.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Legend of Llangefelach Tower.</i>&mdash;A different version of the
  legend also exists in the neighbourhood, viz. that the day's work on the
  tower being pulled down each night by the old gentleman, who was
  apparently apprehensive that the sound of the bells might keep away all
  evil spirits, a saint, of now forgotten name, told the people that if
  they would stand at the church door, and throw a stone, they would
  succeed in building the tower on the "spot where it fell," which
  accordingly came to pass.</p>

  <p><i>Wedding Divination.</i>&mdash;Being lately present on the occasion
  of a wedding at a town in the East Riding of Yorkshire, I was witness to
  the following custom, which seems to take rank as a genuine scrap of
  folk-lore. On the bride alighting from her carriage at her father's door,
  a plate covered with morsels of bride's cake was flung from a window of
  the second story upon the heads of the crowd congregated in the street
  below; and the divination, I was told, consists in observing the fate
  which attends its downfall. If it reach the ground in safety, without
  being broken, the omen is a most <i>un</i>favourable one. If on the other
  hand, the plate be shattered to pieces (and the more the better), the
  auspices are looked upon as most happy.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Shakspearian Drawings.</i>&mdash;I have very recently become
  possessed of some curious drawings by Hollar; those relating to
  Shakspeare very interesting, evidently done for one Captain John Eyre,
  who could himself handle the pencil well.</p>

  <p>The inscription under one is as follows, in the writing of the said J.
  Eyre:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Ye house in ye Clink Streete, Southwarke, now belonging to Master
  Ralph Hansome, and in ye which Master Shakspeare lodged in ye while he
  writed and played at ye Globe, and untill ye yeare 1600 it was at the
  time ye house of Grace Loveday. Will had ye two Rooms over against ye
  Doorway, as I will possibly show."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Size of the drawing, 12 √ó 7, "W. Hollar delin., 1643." It is an
  exterior view, beautifully executed, showing very prominently the house
  and a continuation of houses, forming one side of the street.</p>

  <p>The second has the following inscription in the same hand:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Ye portraiture of ye rooms in ye which Master Will Shakspeare lodged
  in Clink Streete, and which is told to us to be in ye same state as when
  left by himself, as stated over ye door in ye room, and on the walls were
  many printed verses, also a portraiture of Ben Jonson with a ruff on a
  pannel."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Size of the drawing 11&#x215D; √ó 6&#x215E;, "W. Hollar delin., 1643:"
  shows the interior of three sides, and the floor and ceiling, with the
  tables, chairs, and reading-desk; an open door shows the interior of his
  sleeping-room, being over the entrance door porch.</p>

  <p>The third&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Ye Globe, as to be seen before ye Fire in ye year 1615, when this
  place was burnt down. This old building," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here follows a long interesting description. It is an exterior view;
  size of drawing 7¬º wide √ó 9&#x215E; high, "W.&nbsp;H. 1640."</p>

  <p>The fourth shows the stage, on which are two actors: this drawing,
  7&#x215E; √ó 6¬Ω, was done by J. Eyre, 1629, and on which he gives a
  curious description of his accompanying Prince Charles, &amp;c.; at this
  time he belonged to the Court, as he also accompanied that prince to
  Spain.</p>

  <p>The fifth, done by the same hand in a <i>most masterly manner</i>, pen
  and ink portrait of Shakspeare, copied, as he writes, from a portrait
  belonging to the Earl of Essex, with interesting manuscript notice.</p>

  <p>The sixth, done also by J. Eyre:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Ye portraiture of one Master Ben Jonson, as on ye walls of Master
  Will Shakspeare's rooms in Clinke Streete, Southwarke."&mdash;J.&nbsp;E.
  1643.</p>

  documents referred to (as bearing the signature of Thomas Shakspeare) in
  my last <!-- Page 546 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page546"></a>{546}</span> communication to "N. &amp; Q.," Vol.
  vii., p. 405.), and from the <i>nature</i> of the <i>transaction</i> to
  which they relate, <i>my impression</i> is, that he was by profession a
  money scrivener in the town of Lutterworth; a circumstance which may
  possibly tend to the discovery of his family connexion (if any existed)
  with William Shakspeare.</p>

  <p><i>Passage in Macbeth, Act I. Sc. 5.</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ¬∑ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ¬∑ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ¬∑&nbsp; &nbsp;Come, thick night,</p>
      <p>And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,</p>
      <p>That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,</p>
      <p>Nor heaven peep through the <i>blanket</i> of the dark,</p>
      <p>To cry, Hold, hold!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In <span class="sc">Mr. Payne Collier's</span> <i>Notes and
  Emendations</i>, p. 407., we are informed that the old corrector
  substitutes <i>blankness</i> for <i>blanket</i>. The change is to me so
  exceedingly bad, even if made on some sort of authority (as an extinct
  4to.), that I should have let it be its own executioner, had not <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> apparently given in his adhesion to it. I
  now beg to offer a few obvious reasons why <i>blanket</i> is
  unquestionably Shakspeare's word.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Rape of Lucrece</i>, Stanza <span class="sc">cxv</span>., we
  have a passage very nearly parallel with that in <i>Macbeth</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O night, thou furnace of foul reeking smoke,</p>
      <p>Let not the jealous day behold thy face,</p>
      <p>Which underneath thy <i>black all-hiding cloak</i>,</p>
      <p>Immodestly lies martyr'd with disgrace."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In <i>Lucrece</i>, the <i>cloak</i> of night is invoked to screen a
  deed of adultery; in <i>Macbeth</i> the <i>blanket</i> of night is
  invoked to hide a murder: but the foul, reeking, smoky cloak of night, in
  the passage just quoted, is clearly parallel with the smoky blanket of
  night in <i>Macbeth</i>. The complete imagery of both passages has been
  happily caught by Carlyle (<i>Sartor Resartus</i>, 1841, p. 23.), who, in
  describing night, makes Teufelsdr√∂ckh say:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Oh, under that <i>hideous coverlet of vapours, and putrefactions, and
  unimaginable gases</i>, what a fermenting-vat lies simmering and
  hid!"</p>

  <p><i>"Discourse of Reason"</i> (Vol. vii., p. 497.).&mdash;This phrase,
  "generally supposed to be peculiarly Shakspearian," which A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. has

  Bright's <i>Treatise of Melancholy</i>, the date of which is 1586. In the
  third page of the dedicatory epistle there is this sentence:</p>

  <p><i>The MSS. of Gervase Hollis.</i>&mdash;These were taken during the
  reign of Charles I., and continue down to the middle of Charles II. In
  Harl. MSS. 6829, will be found a most curious and valuable volume,
  containing the painted glass, arms, monuments, brasses, and epitaphs in
  the various churches and chapels, &amp;c. throughout the county of
  Lincoln. The arms are all drawn in the margin in colours. Being taken
  before the civil war, they contain all those which were destroyed or
  defaced by the Parliament army. They were all copied by Gough, which he
  notices in his <i>Brit. Top.</i>, vol. i. p. 519., but not printed.</p>

  <p>His genealogical collections are contained in a series of volumes
  marked with the letters of the alphabet, and comprehended in the
  Lansdowne Catalogue under No. 207. The Catalogue is very minute, and the
  contents of the several volumes very miscellaneous; and some of the
  genealogical notes are simply short memoranda, which, in order to be made
  available, must be wrought out from other sources. They all relate more
  or less to the county of Lincoln. One of these, called "Trusbut," was
  presented to the British Museum by Sir Joseph Banks in 1817, and will be
  found in Add. MSS. 6118.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>SMITH, YOUNG, AND SCRYMGEOUR MSS.</h3>

  <p>Thomas Smith, in his <i>Vit√¶ Illustrium</i>, gives extracts from a
  so-called Ephemeris of Sir Peter Young, but which Sir Peter compiled
  during the latter years of his life. Thomas Hearne says, in a note to the
  Appendix to Leland's <i>Collectanea</i>, that he had had the use of some
  of Smith's MSS. This Ephemeris of Sir Peter Young may be worth the
  publishing if it can be found: can any of your readers say whether it is
  among Smith's or Hearne's MSS., or if it be preserved elsewhere? Peter
  Young, and his brother Alexander, were pupils of Theodore Beza, having
  been educated chiefly at the expense of their maternal uncle Henry
  Scrymgeour, to whose valuable library Peter succeeded. It was brought to
  Scotland by Alexander about the year 1573 or 1574, and was landed at
  Dundee. It was especially rich in Greek MSS.; and Dr. Irvine, in his
  "Dissertation on the Literary History of Scotland," prefixed to his
  <i>Lives of the Scottish Poets</i>, says of these MSS. and library, "and
  the man who is so fortunate as to redeem them from obscurity, shall
  assuredly be thought to have merited well from the republic of letters."
  It is much to be feared, however, that as to the MSS. this good fortune
  awaits no man; for Sir Peter Young seems to have given them to his fifth
  son, Patrick Young, the eminent Greek scholar, who was librarian to
  Prince Henry, and, after his death, to the king, and to Charles I.
  Patrick Young's house was unfortunately burned, and in it perished many
  MSS. belonging to himself and to others. If Scrymgeour's MSS. escaped the
  fire, they are to be sought for in the remnant of Patrick Young's
  collection, wherever that went, or in the King's Library, of which a
  considerable part was preserved. Young's house was burned in 1636, and he
  is supposed to have carried off a large number of MSS. from the royal
  library, after the king's death in 1649. If therefore Scrymgeour's MSS.
  were among these, it is possible that they may yet be traced, for they
  would be sold with Young's own, after his death in 1652. This occurred on
  the 7th of September, rather suddenly, and he left no will, and probably
  <span class="correction" title="'give' in original">gave</span> no
  directions about his MSS. and library, which were sold <i>sub hast√¢</i>,
  probably within a few months after his death, and with them any of the
  MSS. which he may have taken from the King's Library, or may have had in
  his possession belonging to others. Smith says that he had seen a large
  catalogue of MSS. written in Young's own hand. Is this catalogue extant?
  Patrick Young left two daughters, co-heiresses: the elder married to John
  Atwood, Esq.; the younger, to Sir Samuel Bowes, Kt. A daughter of the
  former gave to a church in Essex a Bible which had belonged to Charles
  I.; but she knew so little of her grandfather's history that she
  described him as Patrick Young, Esq., library keeper to the king, quite
  unconscious that he had been rector of two livings, and a canon and
  treasurer of St. Paul's. Perhaps, after all, the designation was not so
  incorrect, for though he held so many preferments, he never was in
  priest's orders, and sometimes was not altogether free from suspicion of
  not being a member of the Church of England at all, except as a recipient
  of its dues, and of course, a deacon in its orders.</p>

  <p>But it may be worthy of note, as affording another clue by which,
  perchance, to trace some of Scrymgeour's MSS., that Sir Thomas Bowes,
  Kt., who was Sir Symonds D'Ewes's literary executor, employed Patrick
  Young to value a collection of coins, &amp;c., among which he recognised
  a number that had belonged to the king's cabinet, and which Sir Symonds
  had purchased from Hugh Peters, by whom they had been purloined. Young
  taxed Peters with having taken books, and MSS. also, which the other
  denied, with the exception of two or three, but was not believed. I do
  not know what relation Sir Thomas Bowes was to Sir Samuel, who married
  Young's second daughter, nor to Paul Bowes, who edited D'Ewes's
  <i>Journals</i> in 1682. It is quite possible that some of Scrymgeour's
  MSS. may have fallen into D'Ewes's hands, may have come down, and be
  recognisable by some mark.</p>

  <p>As to Scrymgeour's books, it is probable that they were deposited in
  Peter Young's house of Easter Seatoun, near to Arbroath, of which he
  obtained possession about 1580, and which remained with his descendants
  for about ninety years, when his great-grandson sold it, and purchased
  the castle and part of the lands of Aldbar. That any very fine library
  was removed thither is not probable, especially any bearing Henry <!--
  Page 548 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page548"></a>{548}</span>
  Scrymgeour's name; and for this reason, that Thomas Ruddiman was tutor to
  David Young, and was resident at Aldbar, and would hardly have failed to
  notice, or to record, the existence of any so remarkable a library as
  Scrymgeour's, or even of Sir Peter Young's, who was himself an ardent
  collector of books, as appears from some of his letters to Sir Patrick
  Vans (<i>recte</i> Vaux) which I have seen, and as might be inferred from
  his literary tastes and pursuits. There is perhaps reason to believe that
  Sir Peter's library did not descend in his family beyond his eldest son,
  Sir James Young, who made an attempt to deprive the sons of his first
  marriage (the elder of whom died in infancy) of their right of succession
  to their grandfather's estates, secured to them under their father's
  marriage contract, and which attempt was defeated by their uncle, Dr.
  John Young, Dean of Winchester (sixth son of Sir Peter), who acquired
  from Lord Ramsay, eldest son of the Earl of Dalhousie, part of the barony
  of Baledmouth in Fife. Dean Young founded a school at St. Andrew's, on
  the site of which is now built Dr. Bell's Madras College.</p>

  <p>Sir Peter Young the elder, knighted in 1605, has been sometimes
  confounded with his third son, Peter, who received his knighthood at the
  hands of Gustavus Adolphus, on the occasion of that king being invested
  with the Order of the Garter.</p>

  <p>Another fine library (Andrew Melville's) was brought into Scotland
  about the same time as Scrymgeour's; and it is creditable to the
  statesmen of James's reign that there was an order in the Scotch
  exchequer, that books imported into Scotland should be free from custom.
  A note of this order is preserved among the Harleian MSS. in the British
  Museum; but my reference to the number is not at hand.</p>

  <p><i>Passage in St. James.</i>&mdash;I hope you will not consider the
  following Query unsuited to your publication, and in that case I may
  confidently anticipate the removal of my difficulty.</p>

  <p>In reading yesterday Jeremy Taylor's <i>Holy Living and Dying</i>, I
  came to this passage (p. 308. Bohn's edition):</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"St. James, in his epistle, notes the folly of some men, his
  contemporaries, who were so impatient of the event of to-morrow, or the
  accidents of next year, or the good or evils of old age, that they would
  consult astrologers and witches, oracles and devils, what should befall
  them the next calends&mdash;what should be the event of such a
  voyage&mdash;what God had written in his book concerning the success of
  battles, the election of emperors, &amp;c.... Against this he opposes his
  counsel, that we should not search after forbidden records, much less by
  uncertain significations," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now my Query is, To what epistle of St. James does the eloquent bishop
  refer? If to the canonical epistle, to what part? To the words (above
  quoted) "forbidden records" there is a foot-note, which contains only the
  well-known passage in Horace, lib. i. od. xi., and two others from
  Propertius and Catullus.</p>

  <p><i>Santa Claus.</i>&mdash;Reading <i>The Wide Wide World</i> recalled

  remark, was quite novel to me. <i>Santa Claus</i> I believe to be a
  corruption of <i>Saint Nicholas</i>, the tutelary saint of sailors, and
  consequently a great favourite with the Dutch. Probably, therefore, the
  custom was introduced into the western world by the compatriots of the
  renowned Knickerbocker.</p>

  <p>It is unnecessary to describe the nature of the festivity, as it is so

<h3>Minor Queries with Answers.</h3>

  <p><i>Turkey Cocks.</i>&mdash;Why are Turkey cocks so called, seeing they
  were not imported from Turkey?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Cape</span>.

<div class="note">
  <p>[This Query did not escape the notice of Dr. Samuel Pegge. He says;
  "The cocks which Pancirollus (ii. tit. 1.) mentions as brought from
  America, were Turkey cocks, as Salmuth there (p. 28.) rightly observes.
  The French accordingly call this bird <i>Coq d'Inde</i>, and from
  <i>d'Inde</i> comes the diminutive <i>Dindon</i>, the young Turkey; as if
  one should say, 'the young Indian fowl.' Fetching the Turkey from America
  accords well with the common notion:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Turkeys, carps, hops, pikarel, and beer,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>that is, in the reign of Henry VIII., after many voyages had been made
  to North America, where this bird abounds in an extraordinary manner. But
  Query how this bird came to be called Turkey? Johnson latinizes it
  <i>Gallina Turcica</i>, and defines it, 'a large domestic fowl brought
  from Turkey;' which does not agree with the above account from
  Pancirollus. Brookes says (p. 144.), 'It was brought into Europe either
  from India or Africa.' And if from the latter, it might be called
  <i>Turkey</i>, though but improperly."&mdash;<i>Anonymiana</i>, cent. x.

<h3>"PYLADES AND CORRINA."&mdash;PSALMANAZAR AND
DEFOE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 206. 305. 435. 479.)</p>

  <p>I had forwarded for insertion a short answer to the Query as to
  <i>Pylades and Corinna</i> before <span class="sc">Dr. Maitland's</span>
  communication was printed; but as it now appears more distinctly what was
  the object of the Query, I can address myself more directly to the point
  he has raised. And, in the first place, I cannot suppose that Defoe had
  anything to do with <i>Pylades and Corinna</i>, or the <i>History of
  Formosa</i>. In all Defoe's fictions there is at least some trace of the
  master workman, but in neither of these works <span class="correction"
  title="'in' in original">is</span> there any putting forth of his power,
  or any similitude to his manner or style. When the <i>History of
  Formosa</i> appeared (1704), he was ingrossed in politics, and was not,
  as far as any evidence has yet informed us, in the habit of translating
  or doing journeyman work for booksellers. Then the book itself is, in
  point of composition, far beneath Defoe, even in his most careless moods.
  As to <i>Pylades and Corinna</i>, Defoe died so soon after Mrs.
  Thomas&mdash;she died on the 3rd February, 1731, and he on the 24th April
  following, most probably worn out by illness&mdash;that time seems
  scarcely afforded for getting together and working up the materials of
  the two volumes published. The editor, who signs himself "Philalethes,"
  dates his Dedication to the first volume, in which are contained the
  particulars about Psalmanazar, "St. John Baptist, 1731," which day would
  be after Defoe's death. Nor is there any ground for supposing that Defoe
  and Curll had much connexion as author and publisher. Curll only printed
  two works of Defoe, as far as I have been able to discover, the
  <i>Memoirs of Dr. Williams</i> (1718, 8vo.), and the <i>Life of Duncan
  Campbell</i> (1720, 8vo.), and for his doing so, in each case, a good
  reason may be given. As regards the genuineness of the correspondence in
  <i>Pylades and Corinna</i>, I do not see any reason to question it. Sir
  Edward Northey's certificate, and various little particulars in the
  letters themselves, entirely satisfy me that the correspondence is not a
  fictitious one. The anecdotes of Psalmanazar are quite in accordance with
  his own statements in his Life&mdash;(see particularly p. 183.,
  <i>Memoirs</i>, 1765, 8vo.); and if they were pure fiction, is it not
  likely that, living in London at the time when they appeared, he would
  have contradicted them? In referring (Vol. vii., p. 436., "N. &amp; Q.")
  to the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for these anecdotes, I had not
  overlooked their having appeared in <i>Pylades and Corinna</i>, but had
  not then the latter book at hand to include it in the reference. <span
  class="sc">Dr. Maitland</span> considers <i>Pylades and Corinna</i> "a
  farrago of low rubbish, utterly beneath criticism." Is not this rather
  too severe and sweeping a character? Unquestionably the poetry is but
  so-so, and of the poem the greater part might have been dispensed with;
  but, like all Curll's collections, it contains some matter of interest
  and value to those who do not despise the minuti√¶ of literary
  investigation. The Autobiography of the unfortunate authoress (Mrs.
  Thomas), who was only exalted by Dryden's praise to be ignominiously
  degraded by Pope, and "whose whole life was but one continued scene of
  the utmost variety of human misery," has always appeared to me an
  interesting and rather affecting narrative; and, besides a great many
  occasional notices in the correspondence, which are not without their
  use, there are interspersed letters from Lady Chudleigh, Norris of
  Bemerton, and others, which are not to be elsewhere met with, and which
  are worth preserving.</p>

  <p>For Psalmanazar's character, notwithstanding his early peccadilloes, I
  can assure <span class="sc">Dr. Maitland</span> that I have quite as high
  a respect as himself, even without the corroborative evidence of our
  great moralist, which on such a subject may be considered as perfectly
  conclusive.</p>

<h3>ROBERT WAUCHOPE, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 66.)</p>

  <p>This prelate seems to have been a cadet of the family of Wauchope, of
  Niddry, or Niddry Marischall, in the county of Midlothian, to which
  family once belonged the lands of Wauchopedale in Roxburghshire. The
  exact date of his birth I have never been able to discover, nor which
  "laird of Niddrie" he was the son of. Robert was a favourite name in the
  family long before his time, as is evidenced by an inscription at the
  entry to a burial chapel belonging to the family to this effect: "This
  tome was Biggit Be Robert Vauchop of Niddrie Marchal, and interit heir
  1387." I am at present out of reach of all books of reference, and have
  only a few manuscript memoranda to direct further research; and these
  memoranda, I am sorry to say, are not so precise in their reference to
  chapter and verse as they ought to be.</p>

  <p>According to these notes, mention is made of Robert Wauchope, doctor
  of Sorbonne, by Leslie, bishop of Ross, in the 10th book of his
  <i>History</i>; by Labens, a Jesuit, in the 14th tome of his
  <i>Chronicles</i>; by Cardinal Pallavicino, in the 6th book of his
  <i>Hist. Conc. Trid.</i>; by Fra Paolo Sarpi, in his <i>Hist. Conc.
  Trid.</i> Archbishop Spottiswood says that he died in Paris in the year
  1551, "much lamented of all the university," on his return home from one
  of his missions to Rome.</p>

  <p>One of my notes, taken from the <i>Memoirs of Sir James Melville</i>,
  I shall transcribe, as it is suggestive of other Queries more generally
  interesting. The date is 1545:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Now the ambassador met in a secret part with Oneel(?) and his
  associates, and heard their offers and overtures. And the patriarch of
  Ireland did meet him there, who was a Scotsman born, called Wauchope, and
  was blind of both his eyes, and yet had been divers times at Rome by
  post. He did great honour to the ambassadour, and conveyed him to see St.
  Patrick's Purgatory, which is like an old coal pit which had taken fire,
  by reason of the smoke that came out of the hole."</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>SEAL OF WILLIAM D'ALBINI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 452.)</p>

  <p>The curious article of your correspondent <span
  class="sc">Senex</span> relative to this seal, as described and figured
  in Barrett's <i>History of Attleburgh</i>, has a peculiar interest as
  connected with the device of a man combating a lion.</p>

  <p>The first time I saw this device was in a most curious MS. on
  "Memorial Trophies and Funeral Monuments, both in the old Churches of
  London before the Fire, and the Churches and Mansions in many of the
  Counties of England." The MS. is written by Henry St. George, and will be
  found in Lansd. MSS. 874. The arms and tombs are all elaborately and
  carefully drawn, with their various localities, and the epitaphs which
  belong to them; and the whole is accompanied with an Index of Persons,
  and another of Places.</p>

  <p>At p. 28. this device of a man combating a lion is represented
  associated with a shield of arms of many quarterings, showing the arms
  and alliances of the royal family of Stuart, and is described as having
  formed the subject of a window in the stewards house adjoining the church
  of St. Andrew's, Holborn. In the <i>Catalogue of the Lansdowne MSS.</i>
  is a long and interesting note on this device, with references to the
  various works where it may be found, to which I have had access at the
  Museum, and find them correct, and opening a subject for investigation of
  a most curious kind.</p>

  <p>The figure of the knight, in this drawing, differs considerably from
  that on Dr. Barrett's seal. He is here represented on foot, dressed in
  the chain mail and tunic of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, with a
  close-barred helmet, with a broad flat crown, such as was worn in France
  in the time of Louis IX., called St. Louis. The lion is in the act of
  springing upon him, and he is aiming a deadly blow at him with a ragged
  staff, as his sword lies broken at his feet. The figure is represented as
  fighting on the green sward. From a cloud over the lion proceeds an arm
  clothed in chain mail, and holding in the hand, suspended by a baldrick,
  a shield bearing the arms of France (modern<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>)&mdash;Azure, three fleurs-de-lis
  or. On a scutcheon of pretence in the centre, Argent, a lion ramp. gules,
  debruised with ragged staff, proper. This device forms the 1st quarter of
  the quarterings of the Stuart family.</p>

  <p>In this device there is no figure of a lizard, dragon, or chimera,
  whichever it is, under the horse's feet, as represented in the seal of
  D'Albini.</p>

  <p>I could much extend this reply, by showing the antiquity of this
  device, which by a long process of investigation I have traced as
  connected with the legendary songs of the troubadours; but I think I have
  said sufficient for the present, in reply to <span
  class="sc">Senex</span>.</p>

  <p>In addition to the above, I may mention a seal of a somewhat similar
  character to that of D'Albini, representing a knight on horseback, with
  his sword in his hand, and his shield of arms, which are also on the
  housings of the horse, under whose feet is the dragon: on the reverse is
  the <!-- Page 553 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page553"></a>{553}</span> combat of the knight with the lion. The
  knight is holding his shield in front, and holding his sword in his left
  hand. This seal is that of Roger de Quincy, earl of Winchester, and
  appended to a deed "<span class="sc">m.cc.</span> Quadrigresimo Quinto."
  It occurs in Harl. MSS. 6079. p. 127.</p>

<h3>"WILL" AND "SHALL."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 356.)</p>

  <p>The difficulty as to the proper use of the auxiliaries <i>shall</i>
  and <i>will</i>, will be found to arise from the fact, that while these
  particles respectively convey a different idea in the <i>first</i> person
  singular and plural, from that which they imply in the <i>second</i> and
  <i>third</i> persons singular and plural, the distinction has been lost
  sight of in the amalgamation of <i>both</i>; as if they were
  interchangeable, in <i>one</i> tense, according to the old grammatical
  formula <i>I shall</i> or <i>will</i>. With a view of giving my own views
  on the subject, and attempting to supply what appears to me a grammatical
  deficiency, I shall proceed to make a few remarks; from which I trust
  your Hong Kong correspondent W.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;M. may be able to form "a clear and
  definite rule," and students of English assisted in their attempts to
  overcome this formidable conversational "shibboleth."</p>

  <p>The fact is simply thus:&mdash;<i>Will</i> is <i>volitive</i> in the
  <i>first</i> persons singular and plural; and simply <i>declarative</i>
  or <i>promissory</i> in the <i>second</i> and <i>third</i> persons
  singular and plural. <i>Shall</i>, on the other hand, is
  <i>declaratory</i> or <i>promissory</i> in the <i>first</i> person
  singular and plural; <i>volitive</i> in the <i>second</i> and
  <i>third</i> singular and plural. Thus, the so-called future is properly
  divisible into <i>two</i> tenses: the <i>first</i> implying
  <i>influence</i> or <i>volition</i>; the <i>second</i> (or future proper)
  <i>intention</i> or <i>promise</i>. Thus:</p>


<table class="nob" summary="Shall and Will" title="Shall and Will">
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center">
      <p>1.</p>
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:center">
      <p>2.</p>
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>I <i>will</i> go.</p>

      <p>I <i>shall</i> go.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>Thou <i>shalt</i> go.</p>
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>Thou <i>wilt</i> go.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>He <i>shall</i> go.</p>
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>He <i>will</i> go.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>We <i>will</i> go.</p>
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>We <i>shall</i> go.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>You <i>shall</i> go.</p>

    <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>You <i>will</i> go.</p>

      <p>They <i>shall</i> go.</p>

    <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>They <i>will</i> go.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

  <p>When the above is thoroughly comprehended by the pupil, it will be
  only necessary to impress upon his mind (as a concise rule) the necessity
  of making use of a different auxiliary in speaking of the future actions
  of <i>others</i>, when he wishes to convey the same idea respecting
  <i>such actions</i> which he has done, or should do, in speaking of his
  <i>own</i>, and <i>vice vers√¢</i>. Thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I <i>will</i> go, and you <i>shall</i> accompany me.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>(<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> it is my <i>wish</i> to go, and also that you shall
  accompany me.)</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I <i>shall</i> go, and you <i>will</i> accompany me.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>(<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> <span class="correction" title="'in' in original"
  >it</span> is my <i>intention</i> to go; and believe, or know, that it is
  your <i>intention</i> to accompany me.)</p>

  <p>The philosophical reason for this distinction will be evident, when we
  reflect upon the various ideas produced in the mind by the expression of
  either <i>volition</i> or mere <i>intention</i> (in so far as the latter
  is distinguishable from active <i>will</i>) with regard to <i>our own</i>
  future actions, and the same terms with reference to the future actions
  of <i>others</i>. It will be seen that a mere <i>intention</i> in the
  <i>first</i> person, becomes <i>influence</i> when it extends to the
  <i>second</i> and <i>third</i>; we know nothing, <i>√† priori</i> (as it
  were) of the <i>intentions</i> of others, except in so far as we may have
  the power of <i>determining</i> them. When I say "<i>I</i> shall go"
  (<i>j'irai</i>), I merely express an <i>intention</i> or <i>promise</i>
  to go; but if I continue "<i>You</i> and <i>they</i> shall go," I convey
  the idea that <i>my</i> intention or promise is operative on <i>you</i>
  and <i>them</i>; and the terms which I thus use become unintentionally
  influential or expressive of an extension of <i>my</i> volition to the
  actions of <i>others</i>. Again, the terms which I use to signify
  <i>volition</i>, with reference to <i>my own</i> actions, are but
  <i>declaratory</i> or <i>promissory</i> when I speak of <i>your</i>
  actions, or those of <i>others</i>. I am conscious of <i>my own</i> wish
  to go; but <i>my</i> wish not influencing <i>you</i>, I do, by continuing
  the use of the same auxiliary, but express my belief or knowledge that
  <i>your</i> wish is, or will be, coincident with <i>my own</i>. When I
  say "I will go" (<i>je veux aller</i>), I express a desire to go; but if
  I add, "<i>You</i> and <i>they</i> will go," I simply promise on behalf
  of <i>you</i> and <i>them</i>, or express <i>my</i> belief or knowledge
  that <i>you</i> and <i>they</i> will also desire to go.</p>

  <p>It is not unworthy of note, that the nice balance between <i>shall</i>
  and <i>will</i> is much impaired by the constant use of the ellipse,
  "I'll, you'll," &amp;c.; and that <i>volition</i> and <i>intention</i>
  are, to a great extent, co-existent and inseparable in the <i>first</i>
  person: the metaphysical reasons for this do not here require
  explanation.</p>

  <p>I am conscious that I have not elucidated this apparently simple, but
  really complex question, in so clear and concise a manner as I could have
  wished; but, feeling convinced that my principle at least is sound, I
  leave it, for better consideration, in the hands of your
  correspondent.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Balliolensis</span>, at p. 127. of
  the current volume of "N. &amp; Q.," gives several forms of inscriptions
  in books. The following may prove interesting to him, if not to the
  generality of your readers.</p>

  <p>A MS. preserved in the Biblioth√®que Sainte G√©n√©vi√®ve&mdash;it appears
  to have been the cellarer's book of the ancient abbey of that name, and
  to have been written about the beginning of the sixteenth
  century&mdash;bears on the fly-sheet the name of "Mathieu Monton,

<h3>BACON'S "ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p.493.)</p>

  <p>I have to thank L. for his notice of my edition of the <i>Advancement
  of Learning</i>, as well as for the information which he has given me, of
  which I hope to have an early opportunity of availing myself. As he
  expresses a hope that it may be followed by similar editions of other of
  Bacon's works, I may state that the <i>Essays</i>, with the <i>Colours of
  Good and Evil</i>, are already printed, and will be issued very shortly.
  I am quite conscious that the references in the margin are by no means
  complete: indeed, as I had only <i>hor√¶ subseciv√¶</i> to give to the
  work, I did not attempt to make them so. <!-- Page 555 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page555"></a>{555}</span> But I thought it might
  be useful to give a general indication of the sources from which the
  writer drew, and therefore put in all that I could find, without the
  expenditure of a great deal of time. Consequently I fear that those I
  have omitted will not be found to be the most obvious.</p>

  <p>I shall be glad to make a few remarks on some of the passages noticed
  by L.</p>

  <p>P. 25.&mdash;Of this piece of carelessness&mdash;for which I do not
  the less feel that I deserved a rebuke because L. has not administered
  it&mdash;I had already been made aware by the kindness of a friend. I
  confess I had never heard of Osorius, which is perhaps no great matter
  for wonder; but I looked for his name both in Bayle and the catalogue of
  the library of the British Museum, and by some oversight missed it. I
  have since found it in both. I cannot help, however, remarking that this
  is a good example of the advantage of noting <i>every</i> deviation from
  the received text. Had I tacitly transposed three letters of the word in
  question (a small liberty compared with some that my predecessors have
  taken), my corruption of the text might have passed unnoticed. I have not
  had much experience in these things; but if the works of English writers
  in general have been tampered with by editors as much as I have found the
  <i>Advancement</i> and <i>Essays</i> of Lord Bacon to be, I fear they
  must have suffered great mutilation. I rather incline to think it is the
  case, for I have had occasion lately to compare two editions of Paley's
  <i>Hor√¶ Paulin√¶</i>, and I find great differences in the text. All this
  looks suspicious.</p>

  <p>P. 34.&mdash;I spent some time in searching for this passage in
  Aristotle, but I could not discover it. I did not look elsewhere.</p>

  <p>P. 60.&mdash;In the forthcoming edition of the <i>Essays</i> I have
  referred to Plutarch, <i>Gryll.</i>, 1., which I incline to think is the
  passage Bacon had in his mind. The passage quoted from Cicero I merely
  meant to point out for comparison.</p>

  <p>P. 146.&mdash;The passage quoted is from Sen. <i>ad Lucil.</i>,
  52.</p>

  <p>P. 147.&mdash;<i>Ad Lucil.</i>, 53.</p>

  <p>P. 159.&mdash;<i>Ad Lucil.</i>, 71.</p>

  <p>Two or three other passages from Seneca will be found without any
  reference. One of them, p. 13., "Quidam sunt tam umbratiles ut putent in
  turbido esse quicquid in luce est," I have taken some pains to hunt for,
  but hitherto without success. Another noticeable one, "Vita sine
  proposito languida et vaga est," is from <i>Ep. ad Lucil.</i>, 95.</p>

  <p>For the reference to Aristotle I am much obliged. I was anxious to
  trace all the quotations from Aristotle, but could not find this one.</p>

  <p>P. 165.&mdash;I cannot answer this question. Is it possible that he
  was thinking of St. Augustine? In the <i>Confessions</i>, i. 25., we kind
  the expression <i>vinum erroris</i>.</p>

  <p>P. 177.&mdash;No doubt Bacon had read the treatise of Sallust quoted,
  but my impression is that he thought the proverb had grown out of the
  line in Plautus.</p>

  <p>P. 180.&mdash;I have searched again for "alimenta socordi√¶," as it is
  quoted in the <i>Colours of Good and Evil</i>, but cannot fix upon any
  passage from which I can say it was taken, though there are many which
  might have suggested it. One at p. 19. of the <i>Advancement</i>, which I
  missed at first, I have since met with. It is from the <i>Cherson.</i>,
  p. 106.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Test for a good Lens.</i>&mdash;The generality of purchasers of
  photographic lenses can content themselves with merely the following
  rules when they buy. It ought to be achromatic, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> consisting
  of the usual two pieces of crown and flint glass, that its curves are the
  most recommended, and that it is free from bubbles: to ascertain the
  latter, hold the lens between the finger and thumb of the right hand,
  much as an egg-merchant examines an egg before a strong gas flame, and a
  little to the right of it; this reveals every bubble, however small, and
  another kind of texture like minute gossamer threads. If these are too
  abundant, it should not be chosen; although the best lenses are never
  altogether free from these defects, it is on the whole better to have one
  or two good-sized bubbles than any density of texture; because it
  follows, that every inequality will refract pencils of light out of the
  direction they ought to go; and as bubbles do the same thing, but as they
  do not refract away so much light, they are not of much consequence.</p>

  <p>I believe if a lens is made as thin as it safely can be, it will be
  quicker than a thicker one. I have two precisely the same focus, and one
  thinner than the other; the thinner is much the quicker of the two. An
  apparently indifferent lens should be tried with several kinds of
  apertures, till it will take sharp pictures; but if no size of aperture
  can make it, or a small aperture takes a very long time, it is a bad
  lens. M. Claudet, whose long experience in the art has given him the
  requisite judgment, changes the diameter of his lenses often during the
  day; and tries occasionally, in his excellent plan, the places of the
  chemical focus: by this his time is always nearly the same, and the
  results steady. As he is always free in communicating his knowledge, he
  will, I think, always explain his method when he is applied to. The
  inexperienced photographer is often too prone to blame his lens when the
  failure proceeds more from the above causes. The variation of the
  chemical focus during a day's work is often the cause of disappointment:
  though it does not affect the landscape so much as the portrait operator.
  <!-- Page 556 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page556"></a>{556}</span></p>

  <p>If any one has a lens, the chemical and visual focus being different,
  his only remedy is M. Claudet's method. And this method will also prove
  better than any other way at present known of ascertaining whether a lens
  will take a sharp picture or not. If, however, any plan could be devised
  for making the solar spectrum visible upon a sheet of paper inside the
  camera, it would reduce the question of taking sharp pictures at once
  into a matter of certainty.</p>

  <p>All lenses, however, should be tried by the opticians who sell them;
  and if they presented a specimen of their powers to a buyer, he could see
  in a moment what their capabilities were.</p>

  <p><i>Photography and the Microscope</i> (Vol. vii., p. 507.).&mdash;I
  beg to inform your correspondents R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;F. and J., that in Number 3. of
  the <i>Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science</i> (Highley, Fleet
  Street) they will find three papers containing more or less information
  on the subject of their Query; and a plate, exhibiting two positive
  photographs from collodion negatives, in the same number, will give a
  good idea of what they may expect to attain in this branch of the
  art.</p>

  <p>Practically, I know nothing of photography; but, from my acquaintance
  with the modern achromatic microscope, I venture to say that photography
  applied to this instrument will be of no farther use than as <i>an
  assistant to the draughtsman</i>. A reference to the plates alluded to
  will show how incompetent it is to produce <i>pictures</i> of microscopic
  objects: any one who has seen these objects under a good instrument will
  acknowledge that these specimens give but a very faint idea of what the
  microscope actually exhibits.</p>

  <p>It is unfortunately the case, that the more perfect the instrument,
  the less adapted it is for producing photographic pictures; for, in those
  of the latest construction, the aperture of the object-glasses is carried
  to such an extreme, that the observer is obliged to keep his hand
  continually on the fine adjustment, in order to accommodate the focus to
  the different <i>planes</i> in which different parts of the object lie.
  This is the case even with so low a power as the half-inch
  object-glasses, those of Messrs. Powell and Lealand being of the enormous
  aperture of 65¬∞; and if this is the case while looking through the
  instrument when this disadvantage is somewhat counteracted by the power
  which the eye has, to a certain degree, of adjusting itself to the object
  under observation, how much more inconvenient will it be found in
  endeavouring to focus the whole object at once on the ground glass plate,
  where such an accommodating power no longer exists. The smaller the
  aperture of the object-glasses, in reason, the better they will be
  adapted for photographic purposes.</p>

  <p>Again, another peculiarity of the object-glasses of the achromatic
  microscope gives rise to a farther difficulty; they are over-corrected
  for colour, the spectrum is reversed, or the violet rays are projected
  beyond the red: this is in order to meet the requirements of the
  eye-piece. But with the photographic apparatus the eye-piece is not used,
  so that, after the object has been brought visually into focus in the
  camera, a farther adjustment is necessary, in order to focus for the
  actinic rays, which reside in the violet end of the spectrum. This is
  effected by withdrawing the object-glass a little from the object, in
  which operation there is no guide but experience; moreover, the amount of
  withdrawal differs with each object-glass.</p>

  <p>However, the inconvenience caused by this over-chromatic correction
  may, I think, be remedied by the use of the achromatic condenser in the
  place of an object-glass; that kind of condenser, at least, which is
  supplied by the <i>first</i> microscopic makers. I cannot help thinking
  that this substitution will prove of some service; for, in the first
  place, the power of the condenser is generally equal to that of a quarter
  of an inch object-glass, which is perhaps the most generally useful of
  all the powers; and again, its aperture is, I think, not usually so great
  as that which an object-glass of the same power would have; and,
  moreover, as to correction, though it is slightly spherically
  under-corrected to accommodate the plate-glass under the object, yet the
  chromatic correction is <i>perfect</i>. The condenser is easily detached
  from its "fittings," and its application to the camera would be as simple
  as that of an ordinary object-glass.</p>

  <p>However, my conviction remains that, in spite of all that perseverance
  and science can accomplish, it never will be in the power of the
  photographer to produce a picture of an object under the microscope,
  <i>equally distinct in all its parts</i>; and unless his art can effect
  this, I need scarcely say that his best productions can be but useful
  auxiliaries to the draughtsman.</p>

  <p>I see by an advertisement that the Messrs. Highley supply everything
  that is necessary for the application of photography to the
  microscope.</p>

  <p>In reply to your correspondent J., I would ask if he has any
  photographic apparatus? if so, the answer to his question "What extra
  apparatus is required to a first-rate microscope in order to obtain
  photographic microscopic pictures?" would be <i>None</i>; but if not, he
  would require a camera, or else a wooden conical body, with plate-holder,
  &amp;c., besides the ordinary photographic outfit. Part III. of the
  <i>Microscopical Journal</i>, published by Highley &amp; Son, Fleet
  Street, will give him all the information he requires. <!-- Page 557
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page557"></a>{557}</span></p>

  <p><span class="grk">&phi;</span>. (p. 506.) may find a solution of his
  difficulties regarding the production of stereoscopic pictures, in the
  following considerations. The object of having two pictures is to present
  to <i>each eye</i> an image of what it sees in nature; but as the angle
  subtended by a line, of which the pupils of the eyes form the
  extremities, must differ for every distance, and for objects of varying
  sizes, it follows there is no <i>absolute</i> rule that can be laid down
  as the only correct one. For <i>distant</i> views there is in nature
  scarcely any stereoscopic effect; and in a photographic stereoscopic view
  the effect produced is not really a representation to the eye of the
  <i>view itself</i>, but of <i>a model of such view</i>; and the apparent
  size of the model will vary with the angle of incidence of the two
  pictures, being <i>smaller</i> and <i>nearer</i> as the angle increases.
  I believe Professor Wheatstone recommends for landscapes 1 in 25, or
  about half an inch to every foot.</p>

  <p><i>Cement for Glass Baths.</i>&mdash;In reply to numerous inquiries
  which have appeared in "N. &amp; Q." relative to a good cement for making
  glass baths for photographic purposes, I send a recipe which I copied a
  year or two ago from some newspaper, and which seems likely to answer the
  purpose: I have not tried it myself, not being a photographer.</p>

  <p>Caoutchouc 15 grains, chloroform 2 ounces, mastic ¬Ω an ounce. The two
  first-named ingredients are to be mixed first, and after the gum is
  dissolved, the mastic is to be added, and the whole allowed to macerate
  for a week. When great elasticity is desirable, more caoutchouc may be
  added. This cement is perfectly transparent, and is to be applied with a
  brush cold.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Lyte's Mode of Printing.</i>&mdash;All persons who have
  experienced disappointment in the printing of their positive pictures
  will feel obliged by <span class="sc">Mr. Lyte's</span> suggestion as to
  the bath; but as the preparation of the positive paper has also a great
  deal to say to the ultimate result, <span class="sc">Mr. Lyte</span>
  would confer an additional obligation if he gave the treatment he adopts
  for this.</p>

  <p>I have observed that the negative collodion picture exercises a good
  deal of influence on the ultimate colour of the positive, and that
  different collodion negatives will give different results in this
  respect, when the paper and treatment with each has been precisely the
  same. Does this correspond with other persons' experience?</p>

  <p><i>Eulenspiegel or Ulenspiegel</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 357. 416.
  507.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr. Thoms's</span> suggestion, and his
  quotation in proof thereof from the Chronicler, are farther verified by
  the following inscription and verses which I transcribe from an engraved
  portrait of the famous jester:</p>

<p class="cenhead">"Ulenspiegel.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Ligt Begraben zu Dom in Flandern in der grosen Kirch, auf dem
  Grabister also Likend abgebildet. Starb A<sup>o</sup>. 1301."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These lines are above the portrait, and beneath it are the verses next
  following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Tchau <i>Ulenspiegeln</i> hier. Das Bildniss macht dich lachen:</p>
      <p>Was wurdst du thun siehst du jhn selber Possen machen?</p>
      <p class="i1">Zwar <i>Th√øle</i> ist ein Bild und <i>Spiegel</i> dieser Welt,</p>
      <p>Viel Bruder er verliess; Wir treiben Narrethe√øen,</p>

      <p class="i1">Drum lache deiner selbst; diss Blat dich dir vorstellt."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The portrait, evidently that of a man of large intellect, is very
  life-like, and full of animation. He seems to be some fifty years of age
  or so; he has a cap, ornamented by large feather, on his head. He is
  seated in a chair, has a book in his hand, and is attired in a kind of
  magisterial robe bordered with fur. There is a good-humoured roguish
  twinkle in his eyes; and I should be inclined to call him, judging from
  the portrait before me, an epigrammatist rather than mere vulgar jester.

  <p><i>Old Fogie</i> (Vol. vii., p. 354.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr.
  Keightley</span> supposes the term of <i>old fogie</i>, as applied to
  "mature old warriors," to be "of pure Irish origin," or "rather of Dublin
  birth." In this he is certainly mistaken, for the word <i>fogie</i>, as
  applied to old soldiers, is as well known, and was once as familiarly
  used in Scotland, as it ever was or could have been in Ireland. The race
  was extinct before my day, but I understand that formerly the permanent
  garrisons of Edinburgh, and I believe also of Stirling, Castles,
  consisted of veteran companies; and I remember, when I first came to
  Edinburgh, of people who had seen them, still talking of "the Castle
  fogies."</p>

  <p>Dr. Jamieson, in his <i>Scottish Dictionary</i>, defines the word
  "foggie or fogie," to be first, "an invalid, or garrison soldier,"
  secondly, "a person advanced in life" and derives it from "Su.&nbsp;G.

  <p><i>Enough</i> (Vol. vii., p. 455.).&mdash;In Staffordshire, and I
  believe in the other midland counties, this word is usually pronounced
  <i>enoo</i>, and written <i>enow</i>. In Richardson's <i>Dictionary</i>
  it will be found "enough or enow;" and the etymology is evidently from
  the German <i>genug</i>, from the verb <i>genugen</i>, to suffice, to be
  enough, to content, to satisfy. The Anglo-Saxon is <i>genog</i>. I
  remember the burden of an old song which I frequently heard in my boyish
  days:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="i1">And there get nuts <i>enow</i>."</p>

  <p>This evidently shows what the pronunciation was when it was
  written.</p>

  <p class="author">J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;H.

  <p><i>Enough</i> is from the same root as the German <i>genug</i>, where
  the first <i>g</i> has been lost, and the latter softened and almost lost
  in its old English pronunciation, <i>enow</i>. The modern pronunciation
  is founded, as that of many other words is, upon an affected style of
  speech, ridiculed by Holofernes.<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> The word <i>bread</i>, for example,

  <i>plough</i>. But though spelt <i>enough</i>, is not the word, in both
  places, really <i>enow</i>? and is there not, in fact, a distinction
  between the two words? Does not <i>enough</i> always refer to
  <i>quantity</i>, and <i>enow</i> to <i>number</i>: the former, to what
  may be <i>measured</i>; the latter, to that which may be <i>counted</i>?

  twice, yet for my own part I would not live over my hours past, or begin
  again the thread of my dayes: not upon Cicero's ground&mdash;because I
  have lived them well&mdash;but for fear I should live them worse. I find
  my growing judgment daily instruct me how to be better, but my untamed
  affections and confirmed vitiosity make me daily do worse. I find in my
  confirmed age the same sins I discovered in my youth; I committed many
  then, because I was a child, and, because I commit them still, I am yet
  an infant. Therefore I perceive a man may be twice a child before the
  days of dotage, and stand in need of √Üson's bath before threescore."</p>

  <p>The annotator refers to <i>Cic.</i>, lib. xxiv. ep. 4.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p><i>Passage in the First Part of Faust</i> (Vol. vii., p.

  illustrations of the question he has raised in his second suggestion for
  the elucidation of this passage in <i>The Abbot</i>, chap. 15. <i>ad
  fin.</i> and <i>note</i>.</p>

  <p>A few weeks after giving this reference, in answer to a question by
  <span class="sc">Emdee</span> (see "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. i., p. 262.; Vol.

  additional reply to <span class="sc">Emdee</span>, the very same passage
  that <span class="sc">Mr. Fraser</span> has just forwarded, but it was
  not inserted, probably because its fitness as an illustration was not
  very evident.</p>

  <p>My intention in sending that second reply was to show that, as in
  <i>Christabel</i> and <i>The Abbot</i>, the voluntary and
  <i>sustained</i> effort required to introduce the evil spirit was of a
  physical, so in <i>Faust</i> it was of a mental character; and I confess
  that I am much pleased now to find my opinion supported by the accidental
  testimony of another correspondent.</p>

  <p>It must, however, be allowed that the peculiar wording of the passage
  under consideration may make it difficult, if not impossible, to separate
  <i>earnest</i> from the <i>magical</i> form in which Faust's command to
  enter his room is given. G√∂the's intention, probably, was to combine and
  illustrate both.</p>

  <p><i>Claret</i> (Vol. vii., p. 237.).&mdash;The word <i>claret</i> is
  evidently derived directly from the French word <i>clairet</i>; which is
  used, even at the present day, as a generic name for the "<i>vins
  ordinaires</i>," of a light and thin quality, grown in the south of
  France. The name is never applied but to red wines; and it is very
  doubtful whether it takes its appellation from any place, being always
  used adjectively&mdash;"<i>vin clairet</i>," not <i>vin</i> de
  <i>clairet</i>. I am perhaps not quite correct in stating, that the word
  is always used as an adjective; for we sometimes find <i>clairet</i> used
  alone as a substantive; but I conceive that in this case the word
  <i>vin</i> is to be understood, as we say "du Bordeaux," "du Champagne,"
  meaning "du vin de Bordeaux," "du vin de Champagne." <i>Eau clairette</i>
  is the name given to a sort of cherry-brandy; and lapidaries apply the
  name <i>clairette</i> to a precious stone, the colour of which is not so
  deep as it ought to be. This latter fact may lead one to suppose that the
  wine derived its name from being <i>clearer</i> and lighter in colour
  than the more full-bodied vines of the south. The word is constantly
  occurring in old drinking-songs. A song of Olivier Basselin, the minstrel
  of Vire, begins with these words:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Beau nez, dont les rubis out co√ªt√© mainte pipe</p>
      <p class="i1">De vin blanc et clairet."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>By the way, this song is the original of one in the musical drama of
  <i>Jack Sheppard</i>, which many of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." may
  remember, as it became rather popular at the time. It began thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Jolly nose, the bright gems that illumine thy tip,</p>
      <p class="i1">Were dug from the mines of Canary."</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Now that the season is arriving for the sportsman, angler, yachtsman,
  and lover of nature to visit the wild and solitary beauties of <i>Gamle
  Norge</i>, nothing could be better timed than the pleasant gossiping
  <i>Month in Norway</i>, by J.&nbsp;G. Holloway, which forms this month's issue
  of Murray's <i>Railway Library</i>; or the splendidly illustrated
  <i>Norway and its Scenery</i>, comprising the <i>Journal of a Tour</i> by
  Edward Price, Esq., and a <i>Road Book for Tourists, with Hints to
  Anglers and Sportsmen</i>, edited by T. Forster, Esq., which forms the
  new number of Bohn's <i>Illustrated Library</i>, and <!-- Page 562
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page562"></a>{562}</span> which is
  embellished with a series of admirable views by Mr. Price, from plates
  formerly published at a very costly price, but which, in this new form,
  are now to be procured for a few shillings.</p>

  <p>As the Americans have been among the most successful photographic
  manipulators, we have looked with considerable interest at a work devoted
  to the subject which has just been imported from that country, <i>The
  History and Practice of the Art of Photography, &amp;c.</i>, by Henry H.
  Snelling, <i>Fourth Edition</i>; and though we are bound to admit that it
  contains many hints and notes which may render it a useful addition to
  the library of the photographer, we still must pronounce it as a work put
  together in a loose, unsatisfactory manner, and as being for the most
  part a compilation from the best writers in the Old World.</p>

  <p>When Dr. Pauli's <i>Life of Alfred</i> made its appearance it
  received, as it deserved, our hearty commendation. We have now to welcome
  a translation of it, which has just been published in Bohn's
  <i>Antiquarian Library</i>,&mdash;<i>The Life of Alfred the Great,
  translated from the German of Dr. Pauli; to which is appended Alfred's
  Anglo-Saxon Version of Orosius, with a literal English Translation, and
  an Anglo-Saxon Alphabet and Glossary by</i> Benjamin Thorpe; and it
  speaks favourably for the spread of the love of real learning, that it
  should answer the publisher's purpose to put forth such a valuable book
  in so cheap and popular a form. Mr. Thorpe's scholarship is too well
  known to require recognition at our hands.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received</span>.&mdash;<i>Remains of Pagan
  Saxondom, principally from Tumuli in England, by</i> J.&nbsp;Y. Akerman. The
  present number contains coloured engravings of the <i>Umbo of Shield and
  Weapons found at Driffield</i>, and of a <i>Bronze Patera from a Cemetery
  at Wingham, Kent</i>.&mdash;<i>Gervinus' Introduction to the History of
  the Nineteenth Century</i>. Apparently a carefully executed translation
  of Dr. Gervinus' now celebrated brochure issued by Mr. Bohn; who has, in
  his <i>Standard Library</i>, given us a new edition of <i>De Lolme on the
  Constitution</i>, with notes by J. Macgregor, M.P.; and in his
  <i>Classical Library</i> a translation by C.&nbsp;D. Yonge of <i>Diogenes
  Laertius' Lives and Opinions of the Ancient Philosophers</i>.</p>

  <p>I.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;N. (93rd Highlanders.) <i>Several correspondents, as well as
  yourself, complain of the difficulty of obtaining amber varnish. There
  are several Eastern gums which much resemble amber, as also a substance
  known as "Highgate resin." Genuine amber, when rubbed together, emits a
  very fragrant odour similar to a fresh lemon, and does not abrade the
  surface. The fictitious amber, on the contrary, breaks or becomes rough,
  and has a resinous turpentine-like smell. Genuine amber is to be obtained
  generally of the tobacconists, who have often broken mouth-pieces by
  them: old necklaces, now out of use, are sold at a very moderate price by
  the jewellers. The amber of commerce, used in varnish-making, contains so
  much impurity that the waste of chloroform renders it very undesirable to
  use. The amber should be pounded in a mortar, and, to an ounce by</i>
  measure <i>of chloroform, add a drachm and a half of amber (only about
  one-fourth of it will be dissolved), and this requires two days'
  maceration. It should be filtered through fine blotting-paper. Being so
  very fluid, it runs most freely over the collodion, and, when well
  prepared and applied, renders the surface so hard, and so much like the
  glass, that it is difficult to know on which side of the glass the
  positive really is. The varnish is to be obtained properly made at
  from</i> 2s. <i>to</i> 2s. 6d. <i>per ounce; and although this appears
  dear, it is not so in use, so very small a portion being requisite to
  effectually cover a picture; and the effects exceed every other
  application with which we are acquainted,&mdash;to say nothing of its</i>
  instantaneously <i>becoming hard, in itself a most desirable
  requisite.</i></p>

  <p>&mdash;&mdash; (Islington). <i>Your note has been mislaid, but in all
  probability the spots in your collodion would be removed by dipping into
  the bottle a small piece of iodide of potassium. Collodion made exactly
  as described by</i> <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span> <i>in</i> "N.
  &amp; Q.," <i>entirely answers our expectations, and we prefer it, for
  our own use, to any we have ever been able to procure.</i></p>
